A Ping Visualizer is a tool or application that graphically represents the results of network ping tests. Ping tests measure the time it takes for a packet of data to travel from the sender to a destination and back, along with packet loss rates. A Ping Visualizer takes this data and provides insights in a visual format, such as charts, graphs, or maps, making it easier to analyze network performance and detect issues like high latency or packet loss.
Features of a Ping Visualizer

    Latency Graphs: Display round-trip times over time to help monitor network delays.
    Packet Loss Indicators: Highlight instances where packets fail to reach their destination.
    Geographic Mapping: Show the physical locations of servers or endpoints being pinged, along with latency metrics.
    Real-Time Updates: Continuously update the visualizations for live network monitoring.
    Threshold Alerts: Notify users when ping times or packet loss exceed acceptable levels.

Use Cases

    Network Troubleshooting: Quickly identify network bottlenecks or unstable connections.
    Performance Monitoring: Evaluate and maintain consistent service quality.
    Education: Teach concepts of networking by providing a visual understanding of data transfer delays.

Do you plan to build or use one? Given your background, it might be an interesting project to implement!
